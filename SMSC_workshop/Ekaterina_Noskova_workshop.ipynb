    "We can see that the derived allele has frequency of $1/4$ (one out of four) among four samples on the first position.\n",
    "Let us subsample three individuals from given four samples and compute the frequency of derived allele on the first position.

    "## 6. Overview of GADMA\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is [GADMA](https://github.com/ctlab/GADMA)?\n",
    "- Tool for demographic inference from the genetic data.\n",
    "- Provides demographic history that has highest value of likelihood with the data.\n",
    "- Includes several likelihood components of existing tools under the common interface (`dadi`, `moments`, `momi2`, `momentsLD`)\n",
    "- Has effective global optimization for parameter search.\n",
    "- New model specification using *structure*.\n",
    "- Repeats demographic inference and provides best result among several repeats (30 repeats is good, 100 is better).\n",

    "\n",

    "### What is the model of the demographic history?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical tools for demographic inference require parameterized model of the demographic history. It should be specified using interface of the tool and could be error-prone. For example, let us consider the following model for the demographic history of two populations:\n",
    "- Ancestral population had size equal to $N_{anc}$.\n",
    "- Ancestral population experienced instanstenious growth up to ($nu_{1F}\\cdot N_{anc}$) individuals and it has constant size for ($2\\cdot T_p\\cdot N_{anc}$) generations.\n",
