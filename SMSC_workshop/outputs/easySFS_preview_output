  Processing 1 populations - ['NN']

    Running preview mode. We will print out the results for # of segregating sites
    for multiple values of projecting down for each population. The dadi
    manual recommends maximizing the # of seg sites for projections, but also
    a balance must be struck between # of seg sites and sample size.

    For each population you should choose the value of the projection that looks
    best and then rerun easySFS with the `--proj` flag.
