Welcome to the Demographic Inference using GADMA workshop!

To help everyone get the most out of the sessions, please complete the data preparation and GADMA installation steps before the workshop. Each of these has a dedicated page with step-by-step instructions.


Please complete the following steps:

1. [Setup conda Environment](set_up_conda_env) – follow the instructions to set up the conda environment to be used throughout the workshop.
2. [Data Preparation](data_preparation) – carefully follow the instructions for preparing your own dataset for analysis.
3. [GADMA Installation](gadma_installation) – use the instructions to install and test GADMA. The sample dataset is available on this page so you can check your installation.

**Once you have completed the data preparation and GADMA installation steps, please submit your results and give feedback using the instructions provided** (in the "Let Us Know You Were Successful" section on each page).
This process will help us confirm that everyone is ready and able to fully participate in the hands-on part of the workshop.

If you have questions or encounter any issues, please contact us for assistance.
