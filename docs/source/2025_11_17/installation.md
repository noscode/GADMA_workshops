Welcome to the Demographic Inference from Genomic Data workshop! To ensure all participants are prepared, we request that you complete the installation and setup of two essential tools: ATLAS and GADMA.
Each tool has a dedicated page with step-by-step instructions and links to sample datasets.

Please complete the following steps before the workshop:

1. [Set Up Conda Environment Page](set_up_conda_env) – follow the instructions for setting up `conda` environment.
2. [ATLAS Installation Page](atlas_installation) – follow the instructions for setting up ATLAS and run it with the provided dataset.
3. [GADMA Installation Page](gadma_installation) – follow the instructions to install and run GADMA using the sample data provided.

**Once you have successfully ran test cases for ATLAS and GADMA, you should submit your output results to us using the instructions provided** (section "Let Us Know You Were Successful" on each page).
This process will help us confirm that everyone is ready and able to fully participate in the hands-on part of the workshop.

If you have questions or encounter any issues, please contact us for assistance.
Thank you! We are looking forward to seeing you on the workshop!
