You can find the picture and the Python code of the best model in the output directory.

All best by AIC score models
Number	log-likelihood	AIC score	Model	Units
Run 1	-19.76	39.51	 [Nanc = 10096] [  ]	(theta =  1009.70)	physical, time in generations

INFO: Some numerics (10.08%) for the best model were failed. If this is the end of GADMA run then it is better to run more repeats.

You can find the picture and the Python code of the best model in the output directory.
